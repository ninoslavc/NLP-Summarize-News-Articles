Obama sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate on Saturday night, hours after announcing that he believes military action against Syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons. The proposed legislation from Obama asks Congress to approve the use of military force \"to deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction.\" It s a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle. There are key questions looming over the debate: What did U.N. weapons inspectors find in Syria? What happens if Congress votes no? And how will the Syrian government react? In a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday, the president said he would take his case to Congress, not because he has to -- but because he wants to. \"While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,\" he said. \"We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual.\" Obama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to Washington on September 9. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing over the matter on Tuesday, Sen. Robert Menendez said. Transcript: Read Obama s full remarks Syrian crisis: Latest developments U.N. inspectors leave Syria Obama s remarks came shortly after U.N. inspectors left Syria, carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a Damascus suburb. \"The aim of the game here, the mandate, is very clear -- and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used -- and not by whom,\" U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters on Saturday. But who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a Damascus suburb on August 21 has been a key point of global debate over the Syrian crisis. Top U.S. officials have said there s no doubt that the Syrian government was behind it, while Syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels. British and U.S. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons, but U.N. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors. The inspectors will share their findings with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban, who has said he wants to wait until the U.N. team s final report is completed before presenting it to the U.N. Security Council. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which nine of the inspectors belong to, said Saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected. \"It needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples,\" Nesirky said. He noted that Ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in Syria, and that \"a military solution is not an option.\" Bergen:  Syria is a problem from hell for the U.S. Obama:  This menace must be confronted  Obama s senior advisers have debated the next steps to take, and the president s comments Saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in Syria. Some U.S. lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire. Some global leaders have expressed support, but the British Parliament s vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to Obama s hopes of getting strong backing from key NATO allies. On Saturday, Obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Any military attack would not be open-ended or include U.S. ground forces, he said. Syria s alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month \"is an assault on human dignity,\" the president said. A failure to respond with force, Obama argued,  \"could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm. In a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted.\" Syria missile strike: What would happen next? Map: U.S. and allied assets around Syria Obama decision came Friday night On Friday night, the president made a last-minute decision to consult lawmakers. What will happen if they vote no? It s unclear. A senior administration official told CNN that Obama has the authority to act without Congress -- even if Congress rejects his request for authorization to use force. Obama on Saturday continued to shore up support for a strike on the al-Assad government. He spoke by phone with French President Francois Hollande before his Rose Garden speech. \"The two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the Assad regime -- and others who would consider using chemical weapons -- that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world,\" the White House said. Meanwhile, as uncertainty loomed over how Congress would weigh in, U.S. military officials said they remained at the ready. 5 key assertions: U.S. intelligence report on Syria Syria: Who wants what after chemical weapons horror Reactions mixed to Obama s speech A spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition said that the opposition group was disappointed by Obama s announcement. \"Our fear now is that the lack of action could embolden the regime and they repeat his attacks in a more serious way,\" said spokesman Louay Safi. \"So we are quite concerned.\" Some members of Congress applauded Obama s decision. House Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy and Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers issued a statement Saturday praising the president. \"Under the Constitution, the responsibility to declare war lies with Congress,\" the Republican lawmakers said. \"We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised.\" More than 160 legislators, including 63 of Obama s fellow Democrats, had signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a \"full debate\" before any U.S. action. British Prime Minister David Cameron, whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in Syria failed earlier this week, responded to Obama s speech in a Twitter post Saturday. \"I understand and support Barack Obama s position on Syria,\" Cameron said. An influential lawmaker in Russia -- which has stood by Syria and criticized the United States -- had his own theory. \"The main reason Obama is turning to the Congress:  the military operation did not get enough support either in the world, among allies of the US or in the United States itself,\" Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the international-affairs committee of the Russian State Duma, said in a Twitter post. In the United States, scattered groups of anti-war protesters around the country took to the streets Saturday. \"Like many other Americans...we re just tired of the United States getting involved and invading and bombing other countries,\" said Robin Rosecrans, who was among hundreds at a Los Angeles demonstration. What do Syria s neighbors think? Why Russia, China, Iran stand by Assad Syria s government unfazed After Obama s speech, a military and political analyst on Syrian state TV said Obama is \"embarrassed\" that Russia opposes military action against Syria, is \"crying for help\" for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats -- on the political and military levels. Syria s prime minister appeared unfazed by the saber-rattling. \"The Syrian Army s status is on maximum readiness and fingers are on the trigger to confront all challenges,\" Wael Nader al-Halqi said during a meeting with a delegation of Syrian expatriates from Italy, according to a banner on Syria State TV that was broadcast prior to Obama s address. An anchor on Syrian state television said Obama \"appeared to be preparing for an aggression on Syria based on repeated lies.\" A top Syrian diplomat told the state television network that Obama was facing pressure to take military action from Israel, Turkey, some Arabs and right-wing extremists in the United States. \"I think he has done well by doing what Cameron did in terms of taking the issue to Parliament,\" said Bashar Jaafari, Syria s ambassador to the United Nations. Both Obama and Cameron, he said, \"climbed to the top of the tree and don t know how to get down.\" The Syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the August 21 attack, saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against it. British intelligence had put the number of people killed in the attack at more than 350. On Saturday, Obama said \"all told, well over 1,000 people were murdered.\" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday cited a death toll of 1,429, more than 400 of them children. No explanation was offered for the discrepancy.

The fastest man in the world charged clear of United States rival Justin Gatlin as the Jamaican quartet of Nesta Carter, Kemar Bailey-Cole, Nickel Ashmeade and Bolt won in 37.36 seconds. The U.S finished second in 37.56 seconds with Canada taking the bronze after Britain were disqualified for a faulty handover. The 26-year-old Bolt has now collected eight gold medals at world championships, equaling the record held by American trio Carl Lewis, Michael Johnson and Allyson Felix, not to mention the small matter of six Olympic titles. The relay triumph followed individual successes in the 100 and 200 meters in the Russian capital. \"I m proud of myself and I ll continue to work to dominate for as long as possible,\" Bolt said, having previously expressed his intention to carry on until the 2016 Rio Olympics. Victory was never seriously in doubt once he got the baton safely in hand from Ashmeade, while Gatlin and the United States third leg runner Rakieem Salaam had problems. Gatlin strayed out of his lane as he struggled to get full control of their baton and was never able to get on terms with Bolt. Earlier, Jamaica s women underlined their dominance in the sprint events by winning the 4x100m relay gold, anchored by Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who like Bolt was completing a triple. Their quartet recorded a championship record of 41.29 seconds, well clear of France, who crossed the line in second place in 42.73 seconds. Defending champions, the United States, were initially back in the bronze medal position after losing time on the second handover between Alexandria Anderson and English Gardner, but promoted to silver when France were subsequently disqualified for an illegal handover. The British quartet, who were initially fourth, were promoted to the bronze which eluded their men s team. Fraser-Pryce, like Bolt aged 26, became the first woman to achieve three golds in the 100-200 and the relay. In other final action on the last day of the championships, France s Teddy Tamgho became the third man to leap over 18m in the triple jump, exceeding the mark by four centimeters to take gold. Germany s Christina Obergfoll finally took gold at global level in the women s javelin after five previous silvers, while Kenya s Asbel Kiprop easily won a tactical men s 1500m final. Kiprop s compatriot Eunice Jepkoech Sum was a surprise winner of the women s 800m. Bolt s final dash for golden glory brought the eight-day championship to a rousing finale, but while the hosts topped the medal table from the United States there was criticism of the poor attendances in the Luzhniki Stadium. There was further concern when their pole vault gold medalist Yelena Isinbayeva made controversial remarks in support of Russia s new laws, which make \"the propagandizing of non-traditional sexual relations among minors\" a criminal offense. She later attempted to clarify her comments, but there were renewed calls by gay rights groups for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, the next major sports event in Russia.', ['Usain Bolt wins third gold of world championship', 'Anchors Jamaica to 4x100m relay victory', 'Eighth gold at the championships for Bolt', 'Jamaica double up in women s 4x100m relay']], '00027e965c8264c35cc1bc55556db388da82b07f.story': [' Kansas City, Missouri (CNN) -- The General Services Administration, already under investigation for lavish spending, allowed an employee to telecommute from Hawaii even though he is based at the GSA s Kansas City, Missouri, office, a CNN investigation has found. It cost more than $24,000 for the business development specialist to travel to and from the mainland United States over the past year. He is among several hundred GSA \"virtual\" workers who also travel to various conferences and their home offices, costing the agency millions of dollars over the past three years. Under the program, employees work from home and may live in another state from the region in which they re actually assigned. The Kansas City employee, who started his job in January 2011, is paid $84,440 and works from his home in Honolulu, a GSA representative confirmed. In the past year, according to GSA travel records, the employee has flown back to the mainland nine times for conferences and meetings. Four of those trips were to St. Louis; four were to Washington, with a side trip to Cincinnati; and one was to San Diego. The total cost to taxpayers was $24,221. Jason Klumb, the GSA s regional administrator for Kansas City, defended the hire. \"The cost of that travel was included in the consideration of his candidacy as an employee as compared with the other applicants,\" Klumb said. \"And when factoring all of those in, it was determined that he was the best candidate, even in light of the cost that would be incurred.\" Klumb called the GSA s teleworking program \"a successful program that s going to lead to cost savings for taxpayers.\" But a GSA spokeswoman said, \"We are not going to defend this type of travel.\" And a GSA employee in Kansas City, who requested anonymity, said that hiring someone in Hawaii to work for the Kansas City region was ludicrous. \"It doesn t make sense,\" the employee said. \"When you consider everything you need when you hire someone, it would have been better to look for someone in the Kansas City area. It would have reduced the cost of travel by at least 70 percent when you look at just the airfare of what it takes to from Honolulu to Washington, D.C., where a lot of business is done.\" Dan Tangherlini, who was appointed acting GSA administrator this year, said the agency was examining the cost of the entire teleworking program. \"I think the most important part for the GSA to think about is make sure we open ourselves up, avail ourselves to all the smart people in the country, but then also make sure we have a clear business case,\" he said. \"If we have someone who is working in Nebraska but reporting to Boston, there has to be a clear explanation for what value they re providing, and you ve got to give me the business case. You ve got to explain to me why that s a cost-effective move for the American people, and that s a new standard that we re asking everyone at GSA to adhere to.\" The GSA \"virtual employee\" program is different from telework programs offered by many private companies including CNN s parent company, Turner Broadcasting, in which some employees are encouraged to work from home some days of the week, partially to reduce traffic congestion. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform requested details about the GSA s teleworking program in June. That followed disclosures that 95 virtual employees, including 12 in supervisory positions, spent nearly $750,000 in travel costs between October 2010 and June 2011. \"The American people have a right to know that federal bureaucrats who enjoy the benefits of virtual work are eligible and responsible stewards of the taxpayer dollars that support the program,\" according to a letter from committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, to the GSA. The details requested by Issa about the GSA program have not been provided to the committee. CNN also requested the information more than two months ago through the federal Freedom of Information Act but has been repeatedly told by the GSA that FOIA staff members have not finished compiling the material. The General Services Administration, which has more than 12,600 employees and a $26.3 billion budget, is a relatively obscure federal agency that handles government real estate and other non-military procurement. Congress launched an investigation into the GSA after a scathing inspector general s report issued this year showed lavish spending -- $823,000 -- at the agency s Western Regions Conference in Las Vegas in October 2010. The controversy became politically toxic after reports and video clips of the lavish conference were released. The revelation prompted taxpayer indignation, embarrassed the administration and put a spotlight on wasteful spending by the GSA. Jeff Neely, the GSA official who organized the conference, resigned, as did the agency s administrator, Martha Johnson. Two of Johnson s deputies were fired, and eight other employees left the agency. Tangherlini, a former Treasury Department official, took over as acting GSA administrator. In addition to the Las Vegas conference, the GSA apparently spent $330,000 to relocate an employee from Denver to Hawaii and probably millions more on other employees over a two-year period, according to a transcript of an interview with a GSA event planner. And 84 GSA employees, most of them supervisors or other senior staff -- all subjects of inspector general investigations -- are still collecting their bonuses, totaling more than $1 million in taxpayer money. In July, a CNN investigation revealed that the GSA s Kansas City office spent more than $20,000 to send employees to cooking classes to build team spirit. While the classes do not amount to a significant sum of money in the world of trillion-dollar government budgets, insiders said it was part of the free-spending culture that went on for years at the GSA s Kansas City regional headquarters. GSA spokeswoman Betsaida Alcantara said in a statement this year that all the agency s practices are under a top-down review. CNN s Sara Anwar, Elizabeth M. Nunez and Tom Cohen contributed to this report. Watch Erin Burnett weekdays 7pm ET.

Dr. Blaga Stancheva, a family physician and specialist in obstetrics, said both Burkhart and his mother, Dorothee, were her patients in Vancouver while both were applying for refugee status in Canada. \"I was asked to diagnose and treat Harry to support a claim explaining why he was unable to show up in a small-claims court case,\" Stancheva told CNN in a phone interview. She declined to cite the case or Burkhart s role in it. Stancheva said she and other doctors including a psychiatrist diagnosed Burkhart with \"autism, severe anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.\" The diagnosis was spelled out in a letter she wrote for the small-claims court case, Stancheva said. Stancheva, citing doctor-patient confidentiality, would not elaborate further, nor would she identify the psychiatrist involved in the diagnosis. Burkhart, a 24-year-old German national, has been charged with 37 counts of arson following a string of 52 fires in Los Angeles. The charges are in connection with arson fires at 12 locations scattered through Hollywood, West Hollywood and Sherman Oaks, according to authorities. Stancheva said the refugee applications by Burkhart and his mother were denied by the Canadian government, and she has not seen Burkhart since early March of 2010. \"I was shocked and dismayed at what happened in Los Angeles, and it appears he was not being treated for his depression,\" she said. Burkhart was in court on Wednesday for a preliminary hearing. Prosecutors said his \"rage against Americans,\" triggered by his mother s arrest last week, motivated his \"campaign of terror\" with dozens of fires in Hollywood and nearby communities. Burkhart kept his eyes closed and remained limp during most of his hearing, requiring sheriff s deputies to hold him up. The district attorney called his courtroom behavior \"very bizarre.\" \"This defendant has engaged in a protracted campaign in which he has set, the people believe, upwards of 52 arson fires in what essentially amounts to a campaign of terror against this community,\" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Sean Carney said. \"The people believe he has engaged in this conduct because he has a hatred for Americans.\" Carney told the court Burkhart would flee the country if he was allowed out of jail on bond, but Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Upinder Kalra said he had no choice but to set bail. To go free while awaiting trial, Burkhart must post a $2.85 million bond and surrender his German passport. It was revealed that Burkhart is also under investigation for arson and fraud in relation to a fire in Neukirchen, near Frankfurt, Germany. The worst arson sprees in the city s history began last Friday morning with a car fire in Hollywood that spread to apartments above a garage, but no new fires have happened since Burkhart was arrested Monday, Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley said. No one was hurt in the fires, but property damage costs are likely to reach $3 million, authorities said. Cooley called it \"almost attempted murder,\" because people were sleeping in apartments above where Burkhart allegedly set cars on fire with incendiary devices placed under their engines. The criminal complaint filed Wednesday also alleged that the fires were \"caused by use of a device designed to accelerate the fire,\" Cooley said. \"If found true, the allegation could mean additional custody time for the defendant.\" \"In numerous instances, the cars were parked in carports, resulting in the fires spreading to the adjacent occupied apartment buildings,\" a sworn affidavit from a Los Angeles arson investigator said. \"The vast majority of these fires occurred late at night when the occupants of the apartment buildings were asleep.\" Investigator Edward Nordskog s affidavit detailed Burkhart s behavior a day before the fires began, when he was in a federal courtroom during extradition proceedings for his mother. \"While in the audience, the defendant (Burkhart) began yelling in an angry manner,  F--k all Americans.  The defendant also attempted to communicate with his mother who was in custody. Shortly thereafter, the defendant was ejected from the courtroom by Deputy U.S. Marshals,\" Nordskog wrote. Dorothee Burkhart was arrested a day before on an international arrest warrant issued by a district court in Frankfurt, Germany, said federal court spokesman Gunther Meilinger. The 53-year-old German woman is wanted on 16 counts of fraud and three counts of embezzlement, he said. The charges include an allegation that she failed to pay for a breast enhancement operation performed on her in 2004, Meilinger said. Most of the German charges, however, stem from phony real estate deals that Dorothee Burkhart allegedly conducted between 2000 and 2006. \"It is my opinion that the defendant s criminal spree was motivated by his rage against Americans and that by setting these fires the defendant intended to harm and terrorize as many residents of the city and county of Los Angeles as possible,\" Nordskog wrote. A search of Burkhart s Hollywood apartment found newspaper clippings about the Los Angeles fires and articles from Germany reporting similar car fires in Frankfurt, Germany in September, 2011, the investigator said. \"It is my opinion based on my experience that it is highly likely the defendant has a history of setting arson fires in Germany before he came to the United States,\" Nordskog wrote. Burkhart s mother is scheduled for another extradition hearing Friday, while he is due back in court for arraignment on January 24.

Jose Carlos Montano, 18, was arrested on charges of felony rape, rape in concert with force, and penetration with a foreign object, said Richmond Police Lt. Mark Gagan. Montano was arrested Thursday evening in San Pablo, California, a small town about two miles from the city of Richmond, where the crime took place. Montano, who was held in lieu of $1.3 million bail, is accused of taking part in what police said was a 2½-hour assault on the Richmond High School campus.

Any military attack would not be open-ended or include U.S. ground forces, he said. Syria s alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month \"is an assault on human dignity,\" the president said. A failure to respond with force, Obama argued,  \"could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm. In a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted.\" Syria missile strike: What would happen next? Map: U.S. and allied assets around Syria Obama decision came Friday night On Friday night, the president made a last-minute decision to consult lawmakers. What will happen if they vote no? It s unclear. A senior administration official told CNN that Obama has the authority to act without Congress -- even if Congress rejects his request for authorization to use force. Obama on Saturday continued to shore up support for a strike on the al-Assad government. He spoke by phone with French President Francois Hollande before his Rose Garden speech. \"The two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the Assad regime -- and others who would consider using chemical weapons -- that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world,\" the White House said.

House Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy and Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers issued a statement Saturday praising the president. \"Under the Constitution, the responsibility to declare war lies with Congress,\" the Republican lawmakers said. \"We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious, substantive questions being raised.\" More than 160 legislators, including 63 of Obama s fellow Democrats, had signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a \"full debate\" before any U.S. action. British Prime Minister David Cameron, whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in Syria failed earlier this week, responded to Obama s speech in a Twitter post Saturday. \"I understand and support Barack Obama s position on Syria,\" Cameron said.

Both Obama and Cameron, he said, \"climbed to the top of the tree and don t know how to get down.\" The Syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the August 21 attack, saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against it. British intelligence had put the number of people killed in the attack at more than 350. On Saturday, Obama said \"all told, well over 1,000 people were murdered.\" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday cited a death toll of 1,429, more than 400 of them children.

The fastest man in the world charged clear of United States rival Justin Gatlin as the Jamaican quartet of Nesta Carter, Kemar Bailey-Cole, Nickel Ashmeade and Bolt won in 37.36 seconds. The U.S finished second in 37.56 seconds with Canada taking the bronze after Britain were disqualified for a faulty handover. The 26-year-old Bolt has now collected eight gold medals at world championships, equaling the record held by American trio Carl Lewis, Michael Johnson and Allyson Felix, not to mention the small matter of six Olympic titles. The relay triumph followed individual successes in the 100 and 200 meters in the Russian capital. \"I m proud of myself and I ll continue to work to dominate for as long as possible,\" Bolt said, having previously expressed his intention to carry on until the 2016 Rio Olympics. Victory was never seriously in doubt once he got the baton safely in hand from Ashmeade, while Gatlin and the United States third leg runner Rakieem Salaam had problems. Gatlin strayed out of his lane as he struggled to get full control of their baton and was never able to get on terms with Bolt. Earlier, Jamaica s women underlined their dominance in the sprint events by winning the 4x100m relay gold, anchored by Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who like Bolt was completing a triple. Their quartet recorded a championship record of 41.29 seconds, well clear of France, who crossed the line in second place in 42.73 seconds. Defending champions, the United States, were initially back in the bronze medal position after losing time on the second handover between Alexandria Anderson and English Gardner, but promoted to silver when France were subsequently disqualified for an illegal handover. The British quartet, who were initially fourth, were promoted to the bronze which eluded their men s team. Fraser-Pryce, like Bolt aged 26, became the first woman to achieve three golds in the 100-200 and the relay. In other final action on the last day of the championships, France s Teddy Tamgho became the third man to leap over 18m in the triple jump, exceeding the mark by four centimeters to take gold. Germany s Christina Obergfoll finally took gold at global level in the women s javelin after five previous silvers, while Kenya s Asbel Kiprop easily won a tactical men s 1500m final. Kiprop s compatriot Eunice Jepkoech Sum was a surprise winner of the women s 800m. Bolt s final dash for golden glory brought the eight-day championship to a rousing finale, but while the hosts topped the medal table from the United States there was criticism of the poor attendances in the Luzhniki Stadium. There was further concern when their pole vault gold medalist Yelena Isinbayeva made controversial remarks in support of Russia s new laws, which make \"the propagandizing of non-traditional sexual relations among minors\" a criminal offense. She later attempted to clarify her comments, but there were renewed calls by gay rights groups for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, the next major sports event in Russia.', ['Usain Bolt wins third gold of world championship', 'Anchors Jamaica to 4x100m relay victory', 'Eighth gold at the championships for Bolt', 'Jamaica double up in women s 4x100m relay']], [' Kansas City, Missouri (CNN) -- The General Services Administration, already under investigation for lavish spending, allowed an employee to telecommute from Hawaii even though he is based at the GSA s Kansas City, Missouri, office, a CNN investigation has found. It cost more than $24,000 for the business development specialist to travel to and from the mainland United States over the past year. He is among several hundred GSA \"virtual\" workers who also travel to various conferences and their home offices, costing the agency millions of dollars over the past three years. Under the program, employees work from home and may live in another state from the region in which they re actually assigned. The Kansas City employee, who started his job in January 2011, is paid $84,440 and works from his home in Honolulu, a GSA representative confirmed. In the past year, according to GSA travel records, the employee has flown back to the mainland nine times for conferences and meetings. Four of those trips were to St. Louis; four were to Washington, with a side trip to Cincinnati; and one was to San Diego. The total cost to taxpayers was $24,221. Jason Klumb, the GSA s regional administrator for Kansas City, defended the hire. \"The cost of that travel was included in the consideration of his candidacy as an employee as compared with the other applicants,\" Klumb said. \"And when factoring all of those in, it was determined that he was the best candidate, even in light of the cost that would be incurred.\" Klumb called the GSA s teleworking program \"a successful program that s going to lead to cost savings for taxpayers.\" But a GSA spokeswoman said, \"We are not going to defend this type of travel.\" And a GSA employee in Kansas City, who requested anonymity, said that hiring someone in Hawaii to work for the Kansas City region was ludicrous. \"It doesn t make sense,\" the employee said. \"When you consider everything you need when you hire someone, it would have been better to look for someone in the Kansas City area. It would have reduced the cost of travel by at least 70 percent when you look at just the airfare of what it takes to from Honolulu to Washington, D.C., where a lot of business is done.\" Dan Tangherlini, who was appointed acting GSA administrator this year, said the agency was examining the cost of the entire teleworking program. \"I think the most important part for the GSA to think about is make sure we open ourselves up, avail ourselves to all the smart people in the country, but then also make sure we have a clear business case,\" he said. \"If we have someone who is working in Nebraska but reporting to Boston, there has to be a clear explanation for what value they re providing, and you ve got to give me the business case. You ve got to explain to me why that s a cost-effective move for the American people, and that s a new standard that we re asking everyone at GSA to adhere to.\" The GSA \"virtual employee\" program is different from telework programs offered by many private companies including CNN s parent company, Turner Broadcasting, in which some employees are encouraged to work from home some days of the week, partially to reduce traffic congestion. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform requested details about the GSA s teleworking program in June. That followed disclosures that 95 virtual employees, including 12 in supervisory positions, spent nearly $750,000 in travel costs between October 2010 and June 2011. \"The American people have a right to know that federal bureaucrats who enjoy the benefits of virtual work are eligible and responsible stewards of the taxpayer dollars that support the program,\" according to a letter from committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, to the GSA. The details requested by Issa about the GSA program have not been provided to the committee. CNN also requested the information more than two months ago through the federal Freedom of Information Act but has been repeatedly told by the GSA that FOIA staff members have not finished compiling the material. The General Services Administration, which has more than 12,600 employees and a $26.3 billion budget, is a relatively obscure federal agency that handles government real estate and other non-military procurement. Congress launched an investigation into the GSA after a scathing inspector general s report issued this year showed lavish spending -- $823,000 -- at the agency s Western Regions Conference in Las Vegas in October 2010. The controversy became politically toxic after reports and video clips of the lavish conference were released. The revelation prompted taxpayer indignation, embarrassed the administration and put a spotlight on wasteful spending by the GSA. Jeff Neely, the GSA official who organized the conference, resigned, as did the agency s administrator, Martha Johnson. Two of Johnson s deputies were fired, and eight other employees left the agency. Tangherlini, a former Treasury Department official, took over as acting GSA administrator. In addition to the Las Vegas conference, the GSA apparently spent $330,000 to relocate an employee from Denver to Hawaii and probably millions more on other employees over a two-year period, according to a transcript of an interview with a GSA event planner. And 84 GSA employees, most of them supervisors or other senior staff -- all subjects of inspector general investigations -- are still collecting their bonuses, totaling more than $1 million in taxpayer money. In July, a CNN investigation revealed that the GSA s Kansas City office spent more than $20,000 to send employees to cooking classes to build team spirit. While the classes do not amount to a significant sum of money in the world of trillion-dollar government budgets, insiders said it was part of the free-spending culture that went on for years at the GSA s Kansas City regional headquarters. GSA spokeswoman Betsaida Alcantara said in a statement this year that all the agency s practices are under a top-down review. CNN s Sara Anwar, Elizabeth M. Nunez and Tom Cohen contributed to this report. Watch Erin Burnett weekdays 7pm ET.

Dr. Blaga Stancheva, a family physician and specialist in obstetrics, said both Burkhart and his mother, Dorothee, were her patients in Vancouver while both were applying for refugee status in Canada. \"I was asked to diagnose and treat Harry to support a claim explaining why he was unable to show up in a small-claims court case,\" Stancheva told CNN in a phone interview. She declined to cite the case or Burkhart s role in it. Stancheva said she and other doctors including a psychiatrist diagnosed Burkhart with \"autism, severe anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.\" The diagnosis was spelled out in a letter she wrote for the small-claims court case, Stancheva said. Stancheva, citing doctor-patient confidentiality, would not elaborate further, nor would she identify the psychiatrist involved in the diagnosis. Burkhart, a 24-year-old German national, has been charged with 37 counts of arson following a string of 52 fires in Los Angeles. The charges are in connection with arson fires at 12 locations scattered through Hollywood, West Hollywood and Sherman Oaks, according to authorities. Stancheva said the refugee applications by Burkhart and his mother were denied by the Canadian government, and she has not seen Burkhart since early March of 2010. \"I was shocked and dismayed at what happened in Los Angeles, and it appears he was not being treated for his depression,\" she said. Burkhart was in court on Wednesday for a preliminary hearing. Prosecutors said his \"rage against Americans,\" triggered by his mother s arrest last week, motivated his \"campaign of terror\" with dozens of fires in Hollywood and nearby communities. Burkhart kept his eyes closed and remained limp during most of his hearing, requiring sheriff s deputies to hold him up. The district attorney called his courtroom behavior \"very bizarre.\" \"This defendant has engaged in a protracted campaign in which he has set, the people believe, upwards of 52 arson fires in what essentially amounts to a campaign of terror against this community,\" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Sean Carney said. \"The people believe he has engaged in this conduct because he has a hatred for Americans.\" Carney told the court Burkhart would flee the country if he was allowed out of jail on bond, but Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Upinder Kalra said he had no choice but to set bail. To go free while awaiting trial, Burkhart must post a $2.85 million bond and surrender his German passport. It was revealed that Burkhart is also under investigation for arson and fraud in relation to a fire in Neukirchen, near Frankfurt, Germany. The worst arson sprees in the city s history began last Friday morning with a car fire in Hollywood that spread to apartments above a garage, but no new fires have happened since Burkhart was arrested Monday, Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley said. No one was hurt in the fires, but property damage costs are likely to reach $3 million, authorities said. Cooley called it \"almost attempted murder,\" because people were sleeping in apartments above where Burkhart allegedly set cars on fire with incendiary devices placed under their engines. The criminal complaint filed Wednesday also alleged that the fires were \"caused by use of a device designed to accelerate the fire,\" Cooley said. \"If found true, the allegation could mean additional custody time for the defendant.\" \"In numerous instances, the cars were parked in carports, resulting in the fires spreading to the adjacent occupied apartment buildings,\" a sworn affidavit from a Los Angeles arson investigator said. \"The vast majority of these fires occurred late at night when the occupants of the apartment buildings were asleep.\" Investigator Edward Nordskog s affidavit detailed Burkhart s behavior a day before the fires began, when he was in a federal courtroom during extradition proceedings for his mother. \"While in the audience, the defendant (Burkhart) began yelling in an angry manner,  F--k all Americans.  The defendant also attempted to communicate with his mother who was in custody. Shortly thereafter, the defendant was ejected from the courtroom by Deputy U.S. Marshals,\" Nordskog wrote. Dorothee Burkhart was arrested a day before on an international arrest warrant issued by a district court in Frankfurt, Germany, said federal court spokesman Gunther Meilinger. The 53-year-old German woman is wanted on 16 counts of fraud and three counts of embezzlement, he said. The charges include an allegation that she failed to pay for a breast enhancement operation performed on her in 2004, Meilinger said. Most of the German charges, however, stem from phony real estate deals that Dorothee Burkhart allegedly conducted between 2000 and 2006. \"It is my opinion that the defendant s criminal spree was motivated by his rage against Americans and that by setting these fires the defendant intended to harm and terrorize as many residents of the city and county of Los Angeles as possible,\" Nordskog wrote. A search of Burkhart s Hollywood apartment found newspaper clippings about the Los Angeles fires and articles from Germany reporting similar car fires in Frankfurt, Germany in September, 2011, the investigator said. \"It is my opinion based on my experience that it is highly likely the defendant has a history of setting arson fires in Germany before he came to the United States,\" Nordskog wrote. Burkhart s mother is scheduled for another extradition hearing Friday, while he is due back in court for arraignment on January 24.

Jose Carlos Montano, 18, was arrested on charges of felony rape, rape in concert with force, and penetration with a foreign object, said Richmond Police Lt. Mark Gagan. Montano was arrested Thursday evening in San Pablo, California, a small town about two miles from the city of Richmond, where the crime took place. Montano, who was held in lieu of $1.3 million bail, is accused of taking part in what police said was a 2½-hour assault on the Richmond High School campus. Police said as many as 10 people were involved in the rape in a dimly lit back alley at the school, while another 10 people watched without calling 911. The victim was taken to the hospital in critical condition, but was released Wednesday. Four other teenage suspects were arraigned Thursday on charges connected to the rape. Cody Ray Smith, described by the court as older than 14, pleaded not guilty to charges of rape with a foreign object and rape by force. Two other juveniles, Ari Abdallah Morales and Marcelles James Peter, appeared with Smith at the Contra Costa County Superior Court, but did not enter a plea. The court described Morales as younger than 16, and did not give an age for Peter. All three juveniles, who wore bulletproof vests at the hearing, were charged as adults. A fourth person, Manuel Ortega, 19, appeared separately without an attorney and did not enter a plea. He did not wear a protective vest. Another person, Salvador Rodriguez, 21, was arrested Tuesday night, but he was not in court Thursday.', ['Another arrest made in gang rape outside California school', 'Investigators say up to 20 people took part or stood and watched the assault', 'Four suspects appeared in court Thursday; three wore bulletproof vests']]]\n"

      "0001d1afc246a7964130f43ae940af6bc6c57f01.story [' It s official: U.S. President Barack Obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in Syria. Obama sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate on Saturday night, hours after announcing that he believes military action against Syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons. The proposed legislation from Obama asks Congress to approve the use of military force \"to deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction.\" It s a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle. There are key questions looming over the debate: What did U.N. weapons inspectors find in Syria? What happens if Congress votes no? And how will the Syrian government react? In a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday, the president said he would take his case to Congress, not because he has to -- but because he wants to. \"While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,\" he said. \"We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual.\" Obama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to Washington on September 9. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing over the matter on Tuesday, Sen. Robert Menendez said. Transcript: Read Obama s full remarks Syrian crisis: Latest developments U.N. inspectors leave Syria Obama s remarks came shortly after U.N. inspectors left Syria, carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a Damascus suburb. \"The aim of the game here, the mandate, is very clear -- and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used -- and not by whom,\" U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters on Saturday. But who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a Damascus suburb on August 21 has been a key point of global debate over the Syrian crisis. Top U.S. officials have said there s no doubt that the Syrian government was behind it, while Syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels. British and U.S. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons, but U.N. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors. The inspectors will share their findings with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban, who has said he wants to wait until the U.N. team s final report is completed before presenting it to the U.N. Security Council. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which nine of the inspectors belong to, said Saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected. \"It needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples,\" Nesirky said. He noted that Ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in Syria, and that \"a military solution is not an option.\" Bergen:  Syria is a problem from hell for the U.S. Obama:  This menace must be confronted  Obama s senior advisers have debated the next steps to take, and the president s comments Saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in Syria.
